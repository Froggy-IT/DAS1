This project implements merge sort with insertion sort for small subarrays, quick sort with a random pivot, deterministic selection using the median of medians, and a divide-and-conquer closest pair of points algorithm.
It also counts the number of comparisons and tracks the maximum recursion depth to analyze performance.
Running the program sorts an example array and prints the sorted result along with the comparison count and recursion depth.
